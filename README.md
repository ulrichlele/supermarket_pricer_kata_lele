# Supermarket pricer

Tool implemented to offer several product pricing approach in supermarkets.

Somme common pricing are 
	1. Flat amount. Product with a fixed unit price
	2. Quantity base. Based on units of measurement, a price is defined for a product
		E.g: $1.99/pound
		E.g: $5/meter
		E.g: Three for a dollar 
	3. Discount. Some discounts can be applied on a product some examples are: 
		- buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)

This KATA is implemented using TDD approach which can be traced from the different commits.
Also, this KATA makes use of SOLID principles.
